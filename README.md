# daoPowerFuturesFHE: A DEX for Trading FHE-Encrypted Perpetual Futures

daoPowerFuturesFHE is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that facilitates the trading of FHE-encrypted perpetual futures based on the governance power of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). This innovative platform leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology** to ensure that all transaction data remains confidential while enabling users to engage in financial markets with peace of mind.

## Addressing the Governance Power Challenge

In the evolving landscape of decentralized governance, the allocation and distribution of voting power within DAOs are crucial yet often opaque. Participants lack the tools to proactively hedge and price the future governance power of their respective DAOs, leading to inefficiencies and unoptimized decision-making. This project directly addresses this gap by creating a market for trading future governance power distributions, allowing members to make informed choices and secure their positions ahead of significant proposals or votes.

## The FHE Solution

Using **Zama's open-source libraries** such as the **Concrete FHE library**, daoPowerFuturesFHE ensures that every transaction and order is encrypted. This means that while trading occurs, no sensitive information about the governance power or user positions is exposed to unauthorized parties. By employing Fully Homomorphic Encryption, the platform guarantees not only privacy but also the integrity of the trading process, allowing DAOs to embrace financialization without compromising their foundational principles. 

## Core Features

- **Derivative Trading**: Trade perpetual contracts that represent governance power distributions in various DAOs.
- **Privacy by Design**: All trades are FHE-encrypted to ensure users' strategies and positions are kept confidential.
- **Dynamic Market Pricing**: Introduces financial market mechanisms to price and hedge DAO governance, allowing participants to speculate on future voting power distributions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A professional trading interface catering to both amateur and experienced traders in the DeFi space.
- **DAO Governance Integration**: Seamlessly interacts with existing governance frameworks, enabling token holders to engage effectively in the new market.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption SDK** (Concrete, TFHE-rs)
- **Solidity** for smart contract development
- **Node.js** for backend services
- **Hardhat/Foundry** for development and testing environments
- **Web3.js** for interacting with Ethereum blockchain

## Installation Instructions

To set up the daoPowerFuturesFHE project, ensure you have **Node.js** and Hardhat or Foundry installed.

1. **Download the project files directly.**
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies, including Zama's FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

Please do not use `git clone` or any URLs to obtain the repository as it can lead to undesired results or outdated versions.

## Build and Run

To compile, test, and run the daoPowerFuturesFHE project, follow these commands:

1. **Compile the smart contracts**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run tests to ensure everything works as expected**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the contracts to your local blockchain or testnet**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

4. **Start the application**:

   ```bash
   node src/index.js
   ```

### Example Trading Code

Here’s a brief example of how you might interact with the daoPowerFuturesFHE smart contract to create a new FHE-encrypted order:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const { ConcreteFHE, encryptOrder } = require("zama-fhe-sdk");

async function createOrder(amount, price, userAddress) {
    const daoContract = await ethers.getContractAt("daoPowerFuturesFHE", "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS");
    
    // Encrypt the order using Zama's FHE technology
    const encryptedOrder = encryptOrder({ amount, price, userAddress });

    // Send transaction to create the order
    const tx = await daoContract.createOrder(encryptedOrder);
    await tx.wait();

    console.log("Order created successfully:", tx);
}

// Usage
createOrder(10, 1000, "0xYourUserAddress");
```
